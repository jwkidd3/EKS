operating in a shared environment on aws
each student will have their own user name: user1,user2,etc
all labs should take into account that each student will have their own namespace
any namespace should have the users login name as a prefix
resources created in labs should be prefixed with the students user name
labs should be formatted in .md format
presentations should be done i reveal.js paying close attention to formatting so content all fits on the slide and does not overflow. more slides is better than cutting off content
detail and thouroghness in presentation content is critical
labs/presentatin ratio should be 70/30
labs should be no longer than 45 minutes
labs should include all yaml needed
it is ok for a lab to have the student edit a yaml but not create it from scratch
each day should have at least 4 labs
labs should be in a root directory with a seperate directory for each lab with the associated instructions and the needed yaml files
presentations should be in a presentations directory and files named content1 content2 etc
